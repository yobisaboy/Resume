## Personal Profile
This is Yoyo from Hong Kong. I graduated from Centennial College with a three-year Advanced Diploma in Game Programming. Also, I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics, with a focus on China, the US, and international economies. For my past work experience, I held a leadership role at an online service-matching company and a healthcare agency platform. In the workplace, I am a skilled problem-solver and a fast learner who is responsible and organized.

## Summary of Qualification
- Advanced Diploma in Game Programming from Centennial College, Toronto, Canada
- Bachelorâ€™s Degree in China Studies (Economics) from Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong
### Fast Learner
My transition from Economics to Game Programming demonstrates that I am capable of quickly acquiring new knowledge. Additionally, my experience working in start-up companies required me to manage different parts of team operations without guidance. This meant I had to independently search for resources to accomplish my tasks. In the fast-changing IT industry, I believe this adaptability is an essential skill for success.
### Responsible & Organized
While working at a healthcare agency, I was responsible for building the entire workflow system for service matching from scratch and establishing a new team. This demonstrates my ability to plan, organize, and allocate resources efficiently. In school, I participated in lots of group projects, where I took the lead in coordinating teammates and managing deadlines, highlighting my time management, responsibility, and communication skills.
### Skilled at Problem-Solving
During my studies, I consistently performed well in mathematics and programming, showcasing my strong problem-solving abilities. As a customer service team leader in my past work experience, I was always the last resort for handling complaints. This experience strengthened my problem-solving skills and ability to manage difficult situations effectively.
